# tjs-app-library
This is the Official App Library for TJS. To get your JS app there, you must send an email to tjs.appsubmit@gmail.com, in which you should include app file (only .js files will be verified; using jQuery is very appreciated, as TJS uses it) and instructions (you can write them in either .md file or .txt file; how you whish), how to use it. We'll let you know about your app's verification process results, i.e you'll get a response, where you're gonna see, if verification was successful, and if not, we're gonna tell you, why is that, what to change in app etc.
